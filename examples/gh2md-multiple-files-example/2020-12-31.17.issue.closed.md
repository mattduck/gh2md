It seems the string in [templates_markdown.py](https://github.com/mattduck/gh2md/blob/master/src/gh2md/templates_markdown.py#L18) file are not Unicode strings. One of my solutions is:

```diff
# src/gh2md/templates_markdown.py
- COMMENT = r"""#### <img src="{avatar_url}" width="50">[{author}]({author_url}) commented at [{date}]({url}):
+ COMMENT = ur"""#### <img src="{avatar_url}" width="50">[{author}]({author_url}) commented at [{date}]({url}):
```

@akiicat thanks for reporting this. I'm hoping to release a version with the fix sometime this week.

@akiicat I looked into this and had missed that you're running python 2.7. I wasn't able to reproduce the issue in the latest version. I'm going to close this but I'm happy to look at it if you can reproduce in python 3.
