> @JimmyLv Yes, gh2md with python2 can not process issues with Chinese characters.
> Using python3 will solve this problem, see https://github.com/0ut0fcontrol/jimmylv.github.io/commit/76a967c741a2fa6fa1080c3b631228efe1205974.

> I will update the example in this issue and create a  PR to modify [`issues2md.yml`](https://github.com/mattduck/gh2md/blob/master/.github/workflows/issues2md.yml) in `gh2md`.
